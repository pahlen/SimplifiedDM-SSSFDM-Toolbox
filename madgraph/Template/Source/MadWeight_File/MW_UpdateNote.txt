30/10/09:v2.5.1 (OM) - correction of multi-channel weight when they are two identical (for the point of view
		       of aligned peaks)
		     - correction of data.inc when they ar no visible particule
		     - suppress multi-channel peaks associated to T channel
                     - correct blob detection in T-channel (not detected if the blob start with a unaligned peaks)
		     - correct cross-section normalization factor when the cuts are desactivated

16/10/09:v2.5.0 (OM) - New techniques of integration using the multi-channel techniques.
                       All the changes of variables are now used (with weighting techniques) in order
		       to evalute the integrals. This techniques is more stable and faster than the 
		       techniques used before.
                     - Change in MadWeight Analyzer in order to produce some "less" optimazed change of
		       variable, those one fastenize the integration in this new techniques.
		     - Add some weight for the different channel corresponding to incompatible peaks. This
		       is used in the multi-channel techniques ans fastenize and stabelize the integration.
                     - New format for the transfer functions, pass to an xml format. This also comes
		       with a new way to treat transfer function computation which is more clear and 
		       marginally faster. adding the possibility to have a transfer function on missing
		       ET, and on any type of particles.  
		     - Fix the pointless warning in ./bin/PassToMadWeight.py.
		     - Change default value for integration optimization in order to be adapted to the new situation.
		     - inclusion of an (optional) automatic computation of the acceptance term
                       (computed with Pythia/PGS) the cut selection use the verif_event module of MW.
                       this is activated via the MadWeight_card.dat
		       In order to compute the acceptance term, you need a special version of the Pythia-pgs directory
                       (See the wiki)
             (OM+AP) - Inclusion of a new module for the differential graph. This module is still in beta, and need some
		       hardcoding in order to be used. Please contact olivier.mattelaer@uclouvain.be if you want to use this
		       tool at this stage. More information will appear on the wiki when this module will be fully public.
